## UX

### Project Goals

Lockdown Kitchen is part of my Code Institute Full Stack Software Development studies, the Data Centric Development module. The scope for this milestone project is to "Create a web application that allows users to store and easily access cooking recipes", using the CRUD operations of Create, Read, Update, and Delete for their recipes.
This cook book is for people who are working from home or spending most of their time at home during the quarantine ordained because of the pandemic, but they want to cook or bake something easy and tasty from a couple of ingredients.
All of the foods are made from a couple of ingredient anyobody can find in their kitchen. 
The target audience is people around age 18-40, preferring to reach out online resources compared to paper cookbooks,  stuck at home during pandemic, trying to keep social distancing, open to try out new tastes achieved by using basic ingredients.

### User Stories

As a User I would like to:

 - [x] easily acces recipes from different kind of devices.
 - [x] information I am presented with to be positioned in a way that is easy for me to navigate and find things.
 - [x] browse recipes by categories.
 - [x] find recipes by ingredients I have at home.
 - [x] share recipes by adding them to database.
 - [x] edit existing recipes when I find a mistake or I have a better version of the recipe.
 - [x] delete recipes. 
 - [x] see the details about a partical recipe.
 - [x] send a feedback to the developer, so she can fix the bugs faster.
 - [x] get success or error message to know if my feedback is successfully submitted. 
 
### Developer Goals

* Provide a nice, easy to use online cook book where the user can create, edit, delete recipes, and filter them by categories and ingredients.
* Learn by practice about databases, Jinja templating, Materialize, and how to use Python with JavaScript.
* Get an insight into Heroku's platform.

### Design

To make an integrated design for this site, I used Materializecss, and Materialize Icons.
The cards with borders, the logo with angled forms and locked dishes are the reflection of the "lockdown feeling".
The best-used components are cards. I choosed cards as container of the infos, recipes, and detailed descriptions because the structure of a card helps me to organize the information in a user-friendly way.
For providing feedback and adding recipe I used forms with simply put placeholders.

#### Color Scheme

To find out, what colors would match with the cookbook's feeling, I used [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/).
I also used [Eye Dropper Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eye-dropper/hmdcmlfkchdmnmnmheododdhjedfccka) to make sure that colors on my page are consistent.
The two most important colors are blue and aliceblue (almost white). To make the site easy to read, I used these two colors for almost everything.
For Categories and Browse recipes link I used orange. At the Delete button I set red background color as a convention. 

Colors I used: 

- ![#00766B](https://placehold.it/15/00766B/000000?text=+) `#00766B - blue, primary color`
- ![#f0f8ff](https://placehold.it/15/f0f8ff/000000?text=+) `#f0f8ff - aliceblue, secondary color`
- ![#ffab46](https://placehold.it/15/ffab46/000000?text=+) `#ffab46 - orange for category name and browse recipe`
- ![#ff0000](https://placehold.it/15/#ff0000/000000?text=+) `##ff0000 -red, used once, at the Delete button`

#### Fonts

The font I selected to this page is Roboto Slab from [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com/), because it fits perfectly to playful and clear-out theme of the site.
